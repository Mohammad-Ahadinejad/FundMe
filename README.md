NOTE: This code is for practice, and I followed Patrick Collins' tutorial from the following link: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI&t=200s"

Inside the library, there are three functions:

1. getDecimals(): This function retrieves the number of decimal places used for the price data obtained from the Chainlink aggregator. It returns a uint256 value representing the number of decimals.
2. getLatestPrice(): This function retrieves the latest price data from the Chainlink aggregator. It returns the price as a uint256 value, adjusted based on the number of decimals obtained from the getDecimals() function.
3. getConversionRate(uint256 _ETHamount): This function calculates the conversion rate for a given amount of Ether (ETH) based on the latest price data obtained from the getLatestPrice() function. It returns the conversion rate as a uint256 value.
The contract file is called "FundMe.sol" and it is a smart contract for a fundraising platform.

Inside the contract, there are several components:

1. It imports the PriceConverter library using the import statement.
2. It defines an error called NotOwner() to be used for custom error handling.
3. It declares some state variables including an array funders to keep track of funders, a mapping fundersTotalDeposite to store the total deposits made by each funder, and an immutable variable OWNER representing the contract owner's address.
4. It defines a constructor that assigns the contract deployer's address to the OWNER variable.
5. It includes a onlyOwner modifier which restricts certain functions to be called only by the contract owner.
6. It implements the receive() and fallback() functions which are used to handle incoming Ether transfers to the contract. They call the fund() function to process the transfer.
7. The fund() function is used to accept incoming Ether transfers from funders. It checks if the deposited amount has a conversion rate of at least the minimum required USD value (defined as minimumUSD). If the amount is sufficient, the funder's address is added to the funders array and the deposited amount is added to their total deposit in the fundersTotalDeposite mapping.
8. The withdraw() function allows the contract owner to withdraw the total balance of the contract. It sets all the funders' total deposits to zero, empties the funders array, and transfers the contract balance to the contract owner's address. If the transaction fails, it throws a custom error message.
